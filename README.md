## Introduction
My window manager setup for my Linux OS.
Should contain all relevant information
to rebuild my WM from a fresh Ubuntu installation.

#### Setup:
1. Ubuntu 16.04
1. DWM (dynamic window manager)
1. XPS 15 9550

#### Configuration:

To install DWM simply run `make install` on the DWM package.
No modification of the config.mk file is necessary on Ubuntu.

Also place .xinitrc file in the users home directory. This will
configure settings like mousespeed, touchscreen sensitivity, and various
others that interact with the XServer.
